Objective: 

The goal of this dashboard is to provide an overview of people attitudes towards climate change by showcasing data collected from surveys conducted worldwide. It also offers insights on public perceptions and expectation regarding governmental and institutional actions taken in response to climate change.

Data source: 

We use an aggregated data from the Climate Change Opinion Survey that is collected by Meta in partnership with Yale on annual basis. Data (in Excel sheets) from 2022 is explored in this dashboard.

We further group the survey questions into four (4) main subjects to have a structured analysis*: 

* Awareness & Perception

* Personal Importance & Prioritization

* Energy Sources & Usage

* Government Policy & Action
